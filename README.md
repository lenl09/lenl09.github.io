# The Onominute

### What is it?
___
[Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A) defines the 'onosecond' as: 
> The second after you make a terrible mistake. The second when you realise what you just did and that there’s nothing you can do about it, the second when all the now-inevitable consequences flash through your mind. It is the second after you send a text message to the wrong person, after you delete the wrong file, after you spill the secret that you thought they already knew. The “onosecond” is that stomach-dropping, breath-stopping moment when all you can do is say “oh, no”.

_The Onominute_ is a collection of my documentation and notes for learning various scientific topics. The name itself refers to the average number of times I realized my mistakes while learning a new topic, in a single sitting.
