## Explaining the name itself.

[Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A) defines the _'onosecond'_ as:
> The second after you make a terrible mistake. The second when you realise what you just did and that there’s nothing you can do about it, the second when all the now-inevitable consequences flash through your mind. It is the second after you send a text message to the wrong person, after you delete the wrong file, after you spill the secret that you thought they already knew. The “onosecond” is that stomach-dropping, breath-stopping moment when all you can do is say “oh, no”.

The _Onominute_ (or 60 _onoseconds_) is a collection of my documentation and notes for learning various scientific topics. The name itself refers to the average number of times I realized my mistakes while learning a new topic, in a single sitting.

## Some stuff 'bout me!

As an aspiring computational scientist, I love to learn and read about mathematics, natural sciences, visual arts, design theory, and philosophy (especially metaphysics). My name is Nhan Luong (_Luong Ha Tri Nhan_) but most people know me as Len. I'm a Vietnamese student pursuing an Honours year in Computer Science at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Occasionally, I tend to just pick up my camera to go take random photos of cats or regular daily life stuff happening on the streets. I'm also trying to re-learn the piano, which I regrettably gave up on as a kid.

My academic interests are scientific computing (specifically astronomy and physics), computer graphics (simulation and visualisation), and theoretical computer science. I'm hoping to be able to get involved in research projects in those areas!

From now until July 2022, I will be focusing on my Honours thesis supervised by [Professor Daniel Price](https://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/) and [Dr. Max Cordeil](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~maxc/), which is in interactive/immersive visualisation of particle-based fluid simulation for astrophysics. We will be visualising Prof. Daniel's [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations](https://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/#research) using the open-source [IATK Unity3D toolkit](https://github.com/MaximeCordeil/IATK) developed by Dr. Max to interact with the fluid simulation in Virtual Reality.

I don't use IDE, not because I'm **"hardcore"**, but simply because I never learned to use them and I'm still too scared to do so (they look very intimidating!). My favorite text editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/), I have been using `vim` for a bit to do my C classes but I mainly stick with Atom due to its massive community support, and because it looks aesthetically pleasing (I use a custom version of `Atom Material` for the UI and custom `One Dark` for syntax highlighting).

## What is this site about, then?

This will be the main platform where I will be publishing the notes I have taken while trying to learn new subjects and topics to the masses. I want to write them in a way that is accessible and understandable by as many people as possilbe (meaning minimal prerequisite knowledge), not just because I want more people to discover and appreciate the beauty of science but also because it will vastly improve my understanding of the topic. As this is meant as a shared learning experience, not a go-to teaching material, there will **definitely** be errors and I welcome all the feedbacks and suggestions that you may have while reading my contents. Please feel free to email me at lennemo09@gmail.com if you ever notice a mistake!

I will hopefully try to post updates on my projects if there are any, as I want to document my experience working on them as well, recording all the mistakes and challenges I might have faced so it can be helpful in the future for me or some lost soul Googling for the same problem.
